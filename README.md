# 🏡 Housing Price Analysis using Statistical Methods

## 📌 Overview
This project focuses on analyzing housing prices using **statistical methods** and exploratory data analysis (EDA). By leveraging various statistical techniques, we aim to uncover trends, correlations, and key factors affecting real estate pricing.

The dataset includes attributes such as **SquareFeet, Bedrooms, Bathrooms, Neighborhood, YearBuilt, and Price**, which are analyzed using different statistical models.

## 📊 Features & Analysis
- **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:** Handling missing values, outliers, and data formatting.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Understanding distribution, trends, and key metrics in the dataset.
- **Descriptive Statistics:** Measures of central tendency (mean, median, mode) and variability (standard deviation, IQR).
- **Correlation Analysis:** Examining relationships between **SquareFeet, Bedrooms, and Price**.
- **Confidence Intervals:** Estimating price variations with statistical confidence.
- **Hypothesis Testing:** Checking if location or property size significantly impacts house prices.
- **Data Visualization:** Bar charts, histograms, box plots, and heatmaps to support insights.

## 📂 Dataset Description
The dataset consists of the following attributes:

| Column      | Description |
|------------|------------|
| **SquareFeet** | Total house area in square feet. |
| **Bedrooms** | Number of bedrooms. |
| **Bathrooms** | Number of bathrooms. |
| **Neighborhood** | Type of neighborhood (Urban, Suburb, Rural). |
| **YearBuilt** | Construction year of the house. |
| **Price** | Final price of the house (target variable). |

## 📌 How It Works
1. **Load Data** – The dataset is loaded from a CSV file.
2. **Data Cleaning** – Handling missing values, duplicates, and data transformation.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis** – Descriptive statistics and data visualization.
4. **Statistical Testing** – Confidence intervals, correlation, and hypothesis testing.

## 📷 Visualizations & Insights
### 🔹 Data Distribution
- House prices follow a **normal distribution**, peaking around **$200,000 - $250,000**.
- Price range varies from **$0 to nearly $500,000**.

### 📌 Heatmap Analysis
- **SquareFootage vs. Price** → Strong correlation (**0.75**).
- **Bedrooms and Bathrooms** → Weak correlation (**~0.07 & 0.03**).

### 📊 Box Plot Analysis
- Identifies **outliers** and price variations by neighborhood type.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Python** – Core language for statistical analysis.
- **Jupyter Notebook** – Interactive notebook for analysis.
- **Pandas & NumPy** – Data handling and numerical operations.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – Visualization tools.
- **SciPy & Statsmodels** – Statistical testing and modeling.

## 📌 Future Enhancements
- Implementing **Machine Learning models** for better price prediction.
- Including **feature engineering** to improve data insights.
- Expanding dataset to include **economic and market factors**.

## 📌 Conclusion
This project provides a statistical approach to understanding housing prices, focusing on descriptive statistics and hypothesis testing. By analyzing market trends and property attributes, we can gain valuable insights into real estate pricing factors.
